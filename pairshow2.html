				<b style="color:#A569BD">What is correlation</b>
				<a style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
				A correlation is a relationship between two sets of data.<br><br>

				For example, in the equity markets, you may notice that stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) both tend to rise and fall at the same time. The price behavior between the two stocks is not an exact match, but there is enough similarity to say there is a relationship. In this scenario, we can say MSFT and AAPL have a positive correlation.<br><br>

				Further, there are often relationships across markets, such as equities and bonds or precious metals. We often also see a correlation between financial instruments and economic data or even sentiment indicators.<br><br><a>

				<b style="color:#A569BD">Why do corellations matter?</b><a style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
				There are several reasons why correlations are important, here a few benefits of tracking them in the markets –</a><br><br>
				<ol style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
					<li> <b style="color:black">Insights</b> – keeping track of different relationships can provide insight into where the markets are headed. A good example is when the markets turned sharply lower in late February due to the Coronavirus escalation. The price of gold, which is known as an asset investors turn to when their mood for risky investment sours, rose sharply the trading day before the big initial drop in stocks. It acted as a warning signal for those equity traders mindful of the inverse correlation between the two.</li><br>
					<li><b>Strength in correlated moves</b> – It’s much easier to assess trends when there is a correlated move. In other words, if a bulk of the tech stocks on your watchlist are rising, it’s probably safe to say the sector is bullish or that there is strong demand.</li><br>
					<li><b>Diversification</b> – To make sure you have some diversification in your portfolio, it’s a good idea to make sure the assets within it aren’t all strongly correlated to each other.</li><br>
					<li><b>Signal confirmation</b> – Let’s say you want to buy a stock because your analysis shows that it is bullish. You could analyze another stock with a positive correlation to make sure it provides a similar signal.</li>

				<b style="color:#A569BD">Correlation doesn’t imply causation</b><a style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
				<a style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
					A popular saying among the statistics crowd is “correlation does not imply causation.” It comes up often, and it’s important to understand its meaning.<br><br>

					Essentially, correlations can provide valuable insights, but you’re bound to come across situations that might imply a correlation where a relationship does not exist.<br><br>

					As an example, data has shown a sharp rise in Netflix subscribers due to the lockdown that followed the Coronavirus escalation. The idea is that people are forced to stay at home and therefore are more likely to watch tv.<br><br>

					The same scenario has resulted in a rise in electricity bills. People are using more electricity at home compared to when they were at work all day.<br><br>

					If you were blindly comparing the rise in Netflix subscribers versus the rise in electricity usage during the month of lockdown, you might reasonably conclude that the two have a relationship.<br><br>

					However, having some perspective on the manner, it is clear that the two are not related and that it is not likely that fluctuations in one will impact the other moving forward. Rather, the lockdown, an external variable, is the causation for both of these trends.<br><br>

				<b style="color:#A569BD">What is a correlation coefficient?</b><a style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
				<a style="color:black; font-size: 19px">
					We’ve discussed that fluctuations in the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft tend to have a relationship. You might then notice other tech companies also correlate well with the two.<br><br>

					But not all relationships are equal, and the correlation coefficient can help assess the strength of a correlation.<br><br>

					There are a few different ways of calculating a correlation coefficient, but the most popular methods result in a number between -1 and +1.<br><br>

					The closer the number is to +1, the stronger the relationship. If the figure is close to -1, it indicates that there is a strong inverse relationship.<br><br>

					In the finance world, an inverse relationship is where one asset rises while the other drops. Stocks and gold prices have a long-standing inverse relationship.<br><br>

					The closer the correlation coefficient is to zero, the more likely it is that the two variables being compared don’t have any relationship to each other.<br><br>

					The above formula is what’s used to calculate a correlation coefficient using the Pearson method. We will break down this formula.<br><br>

					There are libraries available that can do this automatically, but the following example will show how we can make the calculation manually.<br><br>

					We will start by creating a dataset. We can use the Numpy library to create some random data for us. Here is the code:<br><br>
